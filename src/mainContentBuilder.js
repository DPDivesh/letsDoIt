//#1 Have the buttons have an event Listener to call each function could module pattern for security

function mainContentBuilder(){
  //create container
  //Determine what page we're on if we dont use function call event listeners or make this a constructor and have the event listener call said constructor

}


const specificButton=(()=>{
  //individual button maker
  //prebuilt buttons
  
})();
